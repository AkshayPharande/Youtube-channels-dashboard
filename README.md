# Youtube-channels-dashboard


I Tried to create this dashboard with limited data taken from the kaggle.
In this dashboard,
- I tried to use Microsoft Charticulator to make this amazing bubble chart where the number of subscribers determines the size and colors of the bubble. Details such as the channel name, category, number of subscribers, videos uploaded, and average views are displayed when you hover over the bubble.
- A multi-row card is used to display Summary of most-subscribed channel & It's a static card.
- The top 10 most subscribed channels are displayed on a bar graph, which is a static graph.
- Added line chart to display the number of channels generated over time (999 channels).
- Two buttons are included in this graphic to view the top 25 channels and all channels.
